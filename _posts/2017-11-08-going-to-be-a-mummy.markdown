My other half says, that other than when our son was born, the greatest moment of his life was when I turned to him, my panties and jeans still around my ankles, the biggest smile on my face and said the words "I'm going to be a Mummy".

But our journey of pregnancy didn't start there.  Backtracking briefly,  I had been unwell from 2 weeks after conception (very early, I know, but as they say every pregnancy is different).  I thought I must just have caught a bug, it was only when we went on holiday to Spain and I wasn't interested in the FREE bottle of wine we got with dinner that I thought, "there's something going on here".

It was too early to take a pregnancy test but we had a fair idea of the outcome as I was simply not myself and I just felt... 'different'.  

The following week we had gone grocery shopping and found myself gravitating to the aisle where ta-da the pregnancy tests were shelved.  After humming and ha-ing as to the 'should I purchase, shouldn't I purchase' mantra and the 'which one should I buy' question,  I decided to bite the bullet and bought a double pack Clear Blue Ultra with weeks indicator test kit. If I was going to find out, I wanted to be sure!

Erran, my other half, was beside himself when we got home and wanted to be too involved in the pee-ing on a stick process.  After telling him to go away multiple times, as he was making nervous and giving me stage fright, I was able to relax and let the goods flow.

Erran immediately set a timer and was counting down the seconds to when the result should show.  It took less than a minute and there it was in black and white, no denying it or wondering what the lines displayed were telling us, for as clear as day it was showing on the display, that one little word that changes your life forever, PREGNANT.

I looked up at Erran who was standing over me and he looked at me and there it was, the only words I could fathom in that moment, the disbelief and excitement that overwhelmed inside, "I'm going to be a Mummy."  Which quickly led to dancing around our apartment together, jumping up and down, hugging, kissing and some very mushy, lovey dovey acts which I won't go into detail about.

And thus our story began.
